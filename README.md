# Tick Detection with TensorFlow

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks that demonstrate tick detection using TensorFlow. The notebooks utilize machine learning techniques to identify ticks in images.

## Notebooks

1. [Data Preprocessing](notebooks/data_preprocessing.ipynb): This notebook covers the preprocessing steps for preparing the tick image dataset, including data cleaning, resizing, and normalization.

2. [Model Training](notebooks/model_training.ipynb): This notebook focuses on training a TensorFlow model using the preprocessed tick image dataset. It includes model architecture, training configuration, and evaluation.

3. [Inference and Visualization](notebooks/inference_and_visualization.ipynb): This notebook demonstrates how to perform inference on new tick images using the trained model and visualize the detection results.

## Dataset

The tick image dataset used in these notebooks can be found in the `data` directory. It consists of a collection of labeled images of ticks in various settings.

## Requirements

To run these notebooks, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Jupyter Notebook

Please refer to the notebook instructions for detailed setup and installation steps.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jpow18/TickTerminator.git

    Open Jupyter Notebook:

    bash

    jupyter notebook

    Navigate to the cloned repository and open the desired notebook.

    Follow the instructions within each notebook to execute the code cells and explore tick detection with TensorFlow.
